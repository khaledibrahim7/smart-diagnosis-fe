      title: 'üå°Ô∏è Understanding Common Cold vs. Flu',
      content: `
      The common cold and the flu are both respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. Because these two types of illnesses have similar symptoms, it can be difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone.
      
      The flu is generally worse than the common cold, and symptoms such as fever, body aches, extreme tiredness, and dry cough are more common and intense. Colds are usually milder than the flu and people with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose.
      
      ### Symptoms of the Common Cold:
      - Runny or stuffy nose
      - Sore throat
      - Mild to moderate cough
      - Sneezing
      - Fatigue (mild)
      
      ### Symptoms of the Flu:
      - High fever (100.4¬∞F or higher)
      - Dry cough
      - Muscle aches
      - Chills and sweats
      - Headache
      - Fatigue and weakness
      
      ### How to Treat:
      - **Cold**: Rest, fluids, over-the-counter decongestants and pain relievers.
      - **Flu**: Antiviral medications (if prescribed early), rest, fluids, and fever reducers.
      
      ### Prevention:
      - Wash your hands regularly
      - Avoid close contact with sick individuals
      - Get a flu vaccine every year
      
      ### When to Seek Help:
      - If symptoms last more than 10 days or worsen
      - Difficulty breathing or chest pain
      - Persistent high fever
      - In children: trouble feeding, bluish lips, extreme irritability
      
      If your symptoms become severe, or if you are in a high-risk group (elderly, young children, people with chronic conditions), seek medical advice immediately.

    'what-is-diabetes': {
      title: 'üß¨ What is Diabetes?',
      content: `
      Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (glucose) and released into your bloodstream.
      
      When your blood sugar goes up, your pancreas releases insulin to help your cells absorb the sugar. With diabetes, either your body doesn‚Äôt make enough insulin or can‚Äôt use it effectively.
      
      ### Types of Diabetes:
      - **Type 1 Diabetes**: An autoimmune reaction destroys insulin-producing cells. It‚Äôs usually diagnosed in children and young adults.
      - **Type 2 Diabetes**: Your body doesn‚Äôt use insulin properly. It‚Äôs more common in adults and often linked to obesity and inactivity.
      - **Gestational Diabetes**: Occurs during pregnancy and usually disappears after birth.
      
      ### Symptoms:
      - Frequent urination
      - Increased thirst
      - Unexplained weight loss
      - Fatigue
      - Blurred vision
      - Slow-healing sores
      - Tingling or numbness in hands or feet (especially in type 2)
      
      ### Management:
      - Monitor blood sugar regularly
      - Maintain a healthy diet
      - Exercise regularly
      - Take medications or insulin as prescribed
      - Avoid sugary drinks and processed foods
      
      ### Prevention & Lifestyle:
      - Keep a healthy weight
      - Be physically active
      - Eat balanced meals and control portion sizes
      - Get regular check-ups and screenings
      
      Early diagnosis and proper management are essential to avoid complications such as heart disease, nerve damage, kidney issues, and eye problems. Diabetes is manageable ‚Äî education, support, and lifestyle choices are key!
