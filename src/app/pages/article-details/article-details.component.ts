      title: 'üå°Ô∏è Understanding Common Cold vs. Flu',
      content: `
The common cold and the flu are both respiratory illnesses but they are caused by different viruses. Because these two types of illnesses have similar symptoms it can be difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone.

The flu is generally worse than the common cold and symptoms such as fever, body aches, extreme tiredness, and dry cough are more common and intense. Colds are usually milder than the flu and people with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose.

Symptoms of the Common Cold:
- Runny or stuffy nose
- Sore throat
- Mild to moderate cough
- Sneezing
- Mild fatigue

Symptoms of the Flu:
- High fever (100.4¬∞F or higher)
- Dry cough
- Muscle aches
- Chills and sweats
- Headache
- Fatigue and weakness

How to Treat:
- Cold: Rest, fluids, over-the-counter decongestants and pain relievers.
- Flu: Antiviral medications (if prescribed early), rest, fluids, and fever reducers.

Prevention:
- Wash your hands regularly
- Avoid close contact with sick individuals
- Get a flu vaccine every year

When to Seek Help:
- If symptoms last more than 10 days or worsen
- Difficulty breathing or chest pain
- Persistent high fever
- In children: trouble feeding, bluish lips, extreme irritability

If your symptoms become severe or you are in a high-risk group (elderly, young children, people with chronic conditions), seek medical advice immediately.

Types of Diabetes:
- Type 1: An autoimmune reaction destroys insulin-producing cells. Usually diagnosed in children and young adults.
